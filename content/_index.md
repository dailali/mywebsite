    description: I believe in <span class="default-text bold-text">design, a never ending process.</span> Although it's very hard for a designer to accept it, the design of the final product is never perfect, it can always be improved. I enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team where knowledge and experiences are shared and every member can experience the different phases of the product's lifecycle. I am passionate about making things that user really need and that are accessible to everyone.
